          <p> Mental development must be permanent in the human being, the mind must be constantly 
          	nurtured, should always be encouraged and should strive for excellence at all times, 
          	the stiffness, the lack of intellectual curiosity, routine, and lack of incentives lead
          	 to cerebral and emotional gradual aging. So giving this facts, we present to you this 
          	 web page describing our funadamentals of software design project.</p>

      <h3 class="page_title"> Audience</h3>
      <div class="page_content">
        <p> The audience will be kids from 6 to 15 years old, because at this age our project can cause a 
        	greater impact on their brains because it is easier for kids to assimilate and understand problems 
        	and so they can develop the mathematical and logical skills at their full potential.</p>

        <p> The users can create an profile to use the application and to keep record about the data, stadistics, 
        	brain age and doctor diagnosis. Also in the game he/she is going to be able to watch his/her results 
        	and doctor comments.</p>
        	
        	<p>In the app the user can choose between arithmetic operations, memory games and sudokus where the 
        	application will take measure of the time it takes the user to accomplish the game. From all three games 
        	the total time will be calculated and will be shown in the profile. For every type of game the user can 
        	change the level of difficulty.</p>
        	
        	<p>The web app will be like the mobile app.</p>
        	
        	<p>The users that visits our web/app page will be able to workout their brain with simple 
        	arithmetics problems and with other games like sudoku, memoramas, abstract pictures and more.</p>

   			<p> Kids can have a better performance both in the school and personal
   				 life so that kids be better every day. The first result of the program for 
   				 international student assessment in 2009, indicate that Mexico ranked in the 
   				 48 place of about 65 nations, 33 of the OCDE(Organizacion para la Coperacion 
   				 y el Desarrollo Economicos) in the areas of reading, mathematics and science, 
   				 with a scale of 262 of 698 point. We are looking for a way to cope with this
   				 problem by developing an educative app.</p>

        <p> The end of this project is to cope with the deficient mexican's mathematical skills 
        	since an early age, by providing an efficient app that will help them to maximize their
        	skills, so they will show a better performance in the academic, personal and, in the future,
        	professional life.</p>
